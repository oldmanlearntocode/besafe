                <h2>GOING OUT AT NIGHT</h2>

                <p>Berlin is not a safe place! Not for straight people 
                    <br>and certainly not for gay people. So if you do decide 
                to go out at night make sure that:</p>

                <ul>
                    
                    
                    <li>you do not travel alone. Groups of people provide a greater amount of
                    protection. </li>
                    
                    <li> you tell family and friends where you are going, 
                    and where they can find or contact you. If you are staying alone
                    inform your landlord or neighbours of your whereabouts. And what time
                    they can expect you back</li>
                    
                    <li>stay away from known dangerous areas and places. Do not go to
                    entertainment venues that makes you feel unsafe and uncomfortable.</li>
                    
                    <li>if you meet someone at a bar, club or entertainment area, make
                    sure that your friends, and other people also meet this person.
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>you do not take strangers or people that you have just met to 
                         your room or place where you stay. We all have had those drunken nights out
                         but your saftey takes first priority.</li>
                    
                    <li>make sure that you're communication devices are always charged. Save
                            emergency contact numbers on your phone. Have them readily available when 
                            you need them.</li>
                    
                    <li>have backup numbers in your wallet or on paper incase you cannot
                         access your phone.
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>trust your instincts. If you don't feel safe, remove yourself 
                        from the situation as quickly as possible.</li>

                    <li>If it is becoming late rather sleep over at a friends place than travelling on your own.</li>
           </ul>

                <p>And remember! We all like to enjoy a night out on the town. But our safety comes first!</p>
