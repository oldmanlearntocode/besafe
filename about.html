                <h2>ABOUT</h2>
                <p>This website was created in <br>remembrance of all those LGTBI+
                    people that are no longer with us.</p>
               

            </div>

            <div class="item3">

                <ul>

                    <li>This is a not-for-profit initiative.</li>

                    <li>This website is essentially a reflection of crime incidents against
                        LGBTI+ individuals that fell victim, not only to crime in general, but
                        specifically to alleged or confirmed hate crimes as reported in the media over time.</li>


                    <li>Note that comprehensive hate crime legislation does not exist in South Africa. This
                        makes the reporting and classification of crime against the LGBTI+ community extremely
                        difficult.</li>

                    <li>This is a first attempt and it remains work in progress. Please feel free to provide us
                        with constructive criticism and suggestions that might assist us to improve on this
                        initiative. </li>

                    <li>It is our wish that this website and database will assist other researchers,
                        journalists and bloggers when writing and reporting not only on crime in general but
                        specifically
                        Hate Crimes Against the LGBTI+ Community in South Africa.
                    </li>

                    <li>This website also brings together a disparate group of academic and non-academic sources
                        on crimes against the LGBTI+ Community in South Africa. Many more remain outstanding and
                        we will
                        continue to add more open-source material as time goes on.
                    </li>

                    <li>We took great care not to infringe on any copyright laws and where possible extensively
                        acknowledge
                        and reference newspaper articles and blog posts of other journalists and reporters that
                        regularly report on
                        crimes against the LGBTI+ Community.
                    </li>

                    <li>As a journalist or publisher if for any reason you feel that you have not been
                        sufficiently
                        acknowledged, or "miss quoted" in the source reports or you would like your information
                        to be removed from
                        this website please get into contact with us and
                        we will gladly do so.
                    </li>

                    <li>We also invested time in a list of safety guidelines for our LGBTI+ Community. The
                        guidelines
                        focus on personal safety when going out, visiting clubs and taverns, making use of
                        dating apps as well as meeting up
                        with potential friends. South Africa is not a safe country and it is important that we
                        put
                        our safety first.
                    </li>

                    <li>On our side we will keep this project alive for as long as possible. The current state
                        of crime but more specifically hate crimes against the LGBTI+ community in South Africa
                        is of particular concern.
                        When studying the media reports it is clear that there is a steady increase in crimes
                        against the LGBTI+ community compared
                        to previous years.
                    </li>

                    <li>As source reports become available in the public domain we will update the site.</li>

                    <li><b>Please report any discrepancies to us. It is important that we remain as
                            accurate as possible in our reporting.</b>
                    </li>

                    <li><b>The following remain outstanding:</b> LGBTI+ Hate Crime Database. Whatsapp group for
                        journalists.
                        This will activate a larger footprint of journalists reporting on hate crimes in the
                        media. A central whatsapp number for LGBTI+ community to report hate crimes.</li>
