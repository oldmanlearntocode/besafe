                <p>South Africa is not a safe place! <br>If you do decide 
                    to make use of a dating site make sure that:</p>

                <ul>

                    <li>you do not provide anyone with your private information. We all feel lonely
                        at some point in time but be careful before you share your private information
                        online.</li>

                    <li>when you sign up for an online dating account don't use your regular contact information. Create
                        an alternative email address that can be utilised exclusively for your online presence. 
                        It is also advisable to rather use a nickname.
                    </li>

                    <li>where possible, make use of the messaging facilities provided by most apps. This way you never have to 
                        reveal your private contact details to anybody and if not needed anymore you can delete
                        your profile.
                    </li>

                    <li>you do not make use of photos that appear on other social media profiles. It is normal for people 
                        to request a facial photo of the person they are about to meet.  However be carefull to 
                        use photos that can be used to link or trace you to other social media sites.
                    </li>
                                        
                    <li>you meet in a public place. The risks of inviting people to your residence
                        is far greater than what it was a few years ago. 
                    </li>

                    <li>for your first date you never meet up at the other person's home.</li>

                    <li>you tell someone that you are meeting someone you met on a dating site, and provide them with 
                        the other person's profile information. Screen grab the profile page and send it to your friend. </li>

                    <li>you do not get into strangers' cars. Where possible make use of your own transport. 
                        When you feel unsafe you can leave at your own discretion.</li>


                    <li>you rather get to know the other person better even though you might feel the desire 
                        to take things further the first night.
                    </li>

                    <li>you do not drink alcohol before or during your first date. We all now that alcohol impairs 
                        our judgment and never leave your drinks unattended.
                    </li>

                    <li>you do not take strangers or people that you have just met to 
                        your room or place where you stay. We all have had those drunken nights out
                        but your safety takes first priority.</li>

                <p>And remember! We all like to enjoy a night out on the town. But our safety comes first!</p>
